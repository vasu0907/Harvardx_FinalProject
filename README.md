# Harvardx_FinalProject

Overview: A Gentle Introduction:

This project is designed as a final project submission towards Harvardx data science learning initiative. We use the knowledge gained in the course series and its interdisciplinary area to apply data knowledge using scientific methods, techniques, models and  algorithms.

Aim of the project:  

The aim of the project is to bild a classifer and discover the **Credit Card Fradulent transaction**  which is a majour concern in most of the financial institutes. Analysing fraudelent manually is unfeasible due to huge amount of data and it's complexity. 

Hence we want to make the process ease we will apply some of the modern ML Models,algorithms and techniques in this project.

In the process of finding data information, we use some of the popular Machine Learning methods and techniques, to name: data cleaning, data discovery, data visualisation and some model approaches.

this data set contains transactions made by credit card in september 2013. this dataset was orginally downloaded from **www.kaggle.com/** . which it has 492 frauds and 284807 transactions. 

This dataset is highly unbalanced.

It contains only numerical variables which are results for PCA transactions, and this dataset contains features from V1 to V28 are the principal component obtained with PCA. the only features which are not been transformed are "Time" and "Amount". Feature "Class" is the response variable and it takes values 1 and 0.

some of the models that we use in this project are:
1. Logistic Regression Model.
2. Decision Tree Model.
3. K-Fold Cross Validation.
4. Random Forest.
5. XGBoost.
